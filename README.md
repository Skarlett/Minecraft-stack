# Minecraft-stack

My personal Minecraft stack setup


+ Mapcrafter
+ Nginx
+ Systemd

after properly setting up everything - you should be able to control the server with systemd, which should allow for scheduled tasks.

After the implementation you should be able to run scripts like
`/opt/minecraft/mapcraft.sh`
which will then allow you to see the changes from the webserver.
